## The Qualities of Great Design

### Interpretation

- What is quality? There are many interpretations.
     - What we agree is good
     - Not random
        - Not slapped together. Considered. Details are visible.
     - A lot of *care* when into it
     - Like someone has though of you
     - Easy to use
     - Focused on what you want to do
     - Easy to get things done
     - Hard to achieve
- How would you describe care?
    - Care about what the experience of others is rather than just your own design.
    - Care about something naturally gives more time and effort.

### Significance

- Quality impacts the world in our everyday life.
- What is special about quality? The love for what we are doing shines through.
- Why are we drawn to quality? Survival instinct comes into play.
- Quality evokes trust.

### Aspirations

- Simple
    - Instantly understandable - Apps should not be a burden during real life.
    - It just has to work without causing distraction or losing focus. 
- Stunning
    - High level of polish
    - Active discovery (learn by doing) - rather than passive tool tips
- Timeless
    - Durability of design that stands the test of time
- Positive
    - It has a positive effect on the user's life

### Techniques

- Draw caricatures - Improve understanding - see the world through others eyes
- Prototyping - don't assume that your initial designs will work - go out into the real world and try it
- Be sure to be open to feedback - you can develop blind spots to your own work over time
- Know that you don't know - be modest, be mindful when you design for others
- Ask questions about your design from different perspectives
- Talk about communication with your team

## Whats New in User Notifications

### Grouped Notifications

- Automatic grouping by default
- Use thread identifier for custom grouping
- Note: The user has a system option to group by app or no grouping, which avoids thread ids.
- Summary text option for a notification group

### Content extensions

- Can now have dynamic notification actions for the extension `notificationActions`
- User interactions - Can now receive user interaction events!
- Launching app - can now launch the app from custom user interaction using the default launch action
- Dismissing extension - can now do this from custom UI programmatically
    - This does not clear out the notification, it only dismisses it.

### Notification Management

- Users now have more fine grained control over notifications with a management UI.
- Deep link to in-app settings of notifications (can also now be accessed in system settings) - can be useful for a custom settings view

### Provisional Authorization

- Automatic trial of notifications from your app
- No authorization prompt
- Delivered quietly directly to notification center (with no sound)
- `.provisional` when requesting authorization

### Critical Alerts

- Medical/health, home security, public safety
- Require user to take action immediately
- Bypass do not disturb and ringer switch
- Plays sound
- Requires an entitlement and approval
- `.criticalAlert` when requesting authorization

## Introducing Natural Language

### Natural Language Framework

### Swifty APIs for NLP

- Language identification - `dominantLanguage`
- Tokenization support
- Named entity recognition

- Types of custom models
    - Text Classification - apply a label to a piece of text
        - Sentiment classification
        - Topic classification
        - Domain classification
    - Word Tagging - take a sentence and apply label to each word
        - Part of speech for unsupported language

        - Chunking words into phrases

### Performance

- Available on all platforms
- Standardized text processing
- Optimized for Apple hardware
- Small model sizes

### Privacy

## Building Faster in Xcode

### Increasing Build Efficiency

- "Parallelize Build" setting in build scheme - be sure to keep it checked
- See if you can break large test targets with lots of dependencies into separate targets
- Reduce dependency exposure
- Examine unused dependencies
- Parallelized target build process
- Can now have input/output file lists for run script phases (for phases that have lots of input/output files)
- Documentation now available in Xcode 10 for run script phases
- Measuring build time
- "Build With Timing Summary" new Xcode 10 action
- Dealing with complex expressions
    - Use explicit types for complex computed properties - Speeds up builds and makes code more explicit
    - Provide types in complex closures
    - Break apart complex expressions
    - Use `AnyObject` methods and properties sparingly

### Reducing the Work on Rebuilds

- Turn off Whole Module mode for debug build (use the new incremental setting for debug)
- Incremental builds are file based
- Compiler is conservative when rebuilding
- Changes in function bodies do not affect the files interface
- Dependencies within a module are per-file
- Dependencies across targets are for the whole target
- Mixed source targets
- Keep your generated header minimal
    - Use `private` when possible
    - Use block-based APIs
    - Migrate to Swift 4 (turn off Swift 3 @objc Inference)
- Keep your bridging header minimal
    - Use private categories to break up your interface (less of the interface will be exposed to swift as a result)

## The Life of a Button

### Interaction

- Buttons are indirect controllers of action
- Direct interaction is often preferable
- What happens before/during/after the press of a button
- Feedback: tell or show
- Apply feedback to all three phases of an interaction
- Try options to see what is too little or too much

### Sound

- Timbre: material, shape, excitation
- Frequency: high, low
- Duration: short, long
- Loudness

### Summary

- Details add up to the whole
- Physical world can offer inspiration
- A user interface is more than what you see
- Learn by trying things out

## Creating Great AR Experiences

### AR Interfaces and Interactions

### Getting into AR

- AKRKit needs to understand the world
- Start moving the device
- Show a fixed reference
- Use feedback to guide towards success
- Match this to your app's style

### Presenting content

- Possibilities
    - Use 2D AR (ex: Rainbrow game for controlling with face)
    - VR - no headset required
- Keep text readable - Use perspective or screen space (fixed size) when appropriate
- Keep text to a minimum
- Transition in and out of AR

### Interactions in the world

- Touch
    - Enables direct manipulation - AR is physical
    - It uses gestures you already know
    - Direct manipulation isn't enough - Touch is 2D
- Movement
    - Is 3D
    - The primary interaction in AR
    - Custom movement interactions (SwiftShot is an example)
- Combine touch and movement (select an object then move the device to move the object)
- Indirect controls (controls that are flat on the display)
    - Also enable one handed control

### Creating great looking AR models

- Aim for 60fps throughout the entire experience - Stress test
- Ensure minimal battery impact
- Use high fidelity assets
- Leverage AR Quicklook to preview assets

## A Tour of UICollectionView

- UICollectionViewLayout
    - Visual arrangement of content
    - Invalidation
    - Attributes (bounds, center, frame)
    - Animate between layouts
    - UICollectionViewFlowLayout - line orientation - horizontal/vertical
    - When to go custom? - If it is not a line-based layout - Start with flow before going custom
- Custom layout
    - Provide content size
    - Provide layout attributes `UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes`
    - Prepare the layout
    - Handle bounds changes
- Process delete updates first in descending order
- Process insert updates last in ascending order

## Automating App Store Connect

### App Store Connect API

- Standards base: REST API
- Secure: (JWT)
- Consistent
- Documented

- Getting data
    - api.appstoreconnect.apple.com/v1/users
        - resource self link - detail link from the list response
- Changing data - Support for CRUD
- Relationships - relationship self link (use it to operate on the relationship)
- Errors
- Authentication
    - Create api key
    - generate token
    - send token with every request (in auth header)
- Best practices
    - Protect your private keys (like real keys)
    - Reuse tokens (better performance if they are reused)
    - Use the self links that you get from responses in the next part of the process
    - Check the docs

## Getting to Know Swift Package Manager

### Why a package manager

- Cross platform build system for Swift
- Share swift libraries easily with a canonical package manager tool
- Code reuse beyond the core libraries
- Take full advantage of Swift
- Part of Swift open source project
- Included with Xcode

### How to use it

- build
- run
- test
- package
- works with git tags for releases
- Dependencies
- Targets: basic building blocks for packages
    - They can depend on other targets and products
- Products: executables
- Packages provide products

### Design

- Fast, safe, expressive
- Support for building other languages (but not in the same target as swift)
- Use Semantic versioning
- Dependency resolution support - Package.resolved file
- Testing support

### Evolution

- Package API can be updated with each swift version
- Swift tools version in package file
- Open evolution process
    - Great integration with other tools
    - Publish and deploy
    - Support complex packages
    - Package discovery and trust

### Open source

- Part of the official Swift open source process

## Advanced Debugging with Xcode and LLDB

### Swift debugging reliability

- Improvements with Xcode 10
- Better swift type resolution

### Tips & Tricks

- Separate tab for debug - Add a behavior when the debugger pauses
- Run debugger command to execute an expression to change the value of something
- "po $arg1" get register values
- --one-shot breakpoint
- You can move the instruction pointer of a breakpoint with the grab handle on the right
- "thread jump --by 1" debugger command - jump over 1 line of code
- can get different outputs from "p" vs "po"
- watchpoint - pauses the next time the value of the variable changes
- expression -l objc - O (execute objc code in swift mode)
- po unsafeBitCast on memory address
- CATransaction.flush() !
- Chris Miles
- The nudge LLDB script will be available on the session detail site
- frame variable <name> command

### Advanced View Debugging

- command click on view debugger - stops mouse events
- can copy layout constraint from visual debugger - Edit > copy
- enable malloc stack logging to see object stack in debugger
- hold command to click through views in view debugger
- appearance overrides for debugging dark mode

## Using Collections Effectively

- Avoid index invalidation
- Mutation usually invalidates indexes
- Use caution when keeping indices/slices when using mutable
- Only calculate indices as needed
- Collections optimized for single threaded access
- Avoid concurrent mutation - prefer using a single thread
- Can audit mutable state with thread sanitizer
- Just use immutable collections if feasible
    - Can emulate mutation with slices and lazy
- Use capacity hits if possible when forming new collections
- Foundation collections
    - These are reference collections
    - Bridging converts between runtime types, but it is not free, so pay attention to performance if dealing with very large collections
    - Use them if you need reference semantics or dealing with objc objects

## Designing Notifications

### First run

- Can send the first prompt direct to notification center (along with the first notification)
    - This may be a good approach for app's passive consumption/non critical notifications
    - If people need to see your notifications in a timely manner, then ask for permission in the traditional way
- Dont prompt right on first launch
- Explain why notifications are valuable
- Present at a relevant moment

### Provide value

- attention is valuable
- Send great content - each message should have a specific purpose (not just a reason to get someone to launch the app)
- Be considerate about notification delivery
- Smart customization
    - "Customize in App..." option will be displayed when the user turns off notifications
    - Give granular control over different categories

### Notification grouping

- Examples
    - News app groups notifications by news source
    - Podcasts app groups episode notifications by podcast
- Its ok to just group by app (the default behavior)

### Richer Rich notifications

- Make rich notifications self-contained - Not required to launch into app to get value
- iOS 12 adds user interaction to rich notification UI
- Rich notifications can also be grouped

### Apple Watch

- Primary way people interact with apps on the watch
- Notifications get sent to the device that is most accessible to you (make sure the notification looks great in both places)
- Interactive notification support
    - Informative, Visually Rich, Actionable, Quick interactions
- Get to know your audience and tailor the notification to their needs

## Understanding Crashes and Crash Logs

### Fundamentals

- Impossible for the CPU to execute code
- Operating system is enforcing a policy
- Language is preventing failure
- Developer is preventing failure

### Accessing crash logs

- Can use the crashes organizer in Xcode
- Works with testflight and app store
- Can also access from the devices window
- Can also access if automated tests crash
- Console app
- Sharing from device
- Symbolication
    - Upload app symbols for server side symbolication
    - Keep your app archive for local symbolication
    - Download debug symbols for debug apps

### Analyzing crash logs

- Understand the crash reason
- Examine the stack trace
- Look for more clues in disassembly
- OS level crashes: Watchdog events, device overheated, memory exhaustion, invalid code signing,
- TN2151 for details
- SIGKILL operating system killed the process
- Launch timeouts can trigger app review rejection
- Watchdog timeouts are disabled in the simulator and in the debugger
- Test with older hardware

### Memory Errors

- EXC_BAD_ACCESS - memory error
- Can import a crashlog into lldb
- objc_msgSend or retain/release
- Unrecognized selector
- `abort()` inside malloc/free
