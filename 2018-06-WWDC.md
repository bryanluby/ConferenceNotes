## Introduction to Siri Shortcuts

- Expose key capabilities of your app to Siri

### Adopting shortcuts

- Define your shortcut
    - Accelerate a key function of your app
    - Pe of persistent interest to the user
    - Be executable at any time
- NSUserActivity - Good for simple shortcuts
    - Declare a type in info.plist
    - `isEligibleForPrediction`flag on user activities - Requires `iseligibleforsearch` as a prerequisite
- Intents - offer the best experience
    - Custom intents if the defaults dont apply
    - Specify shortcut types + support background execution
    - Need to use an intent extension for handling the shortcut flow inline with Siri rather than having to launch the app
- Donate shortcut (expose it)
- Handle shortcut when it is used
- `INRelevantShortcut` - expose to the Siri watch face - Works even if you dont have a watch app
- Developer setting in System settings to display donations on the lock screen

### Optimizing shortcuts

###  Privacy

### Media playback

## Whats New in Testing

### Code coverage

- Reports: reduced file size, faster read/write performance, more accurate
- Target selection
- xccov - support for json output

### Test selection and ordering

- "Tests to run" scheme setting - Helpful for separating nightly test runs
- Test ordering - Randomized test ordering for each run (can uncover implicit dependencies)

### Parallel testing

- Parallel distributed testing - execute tests in parallel on a single destination
    - Works in both Xcode and xcodebuild
    - Classes execute in parallel
    - Automatically create and tear down simulator clones
    - Original simulator is like a template for the simulator clones
    - Each clone has its own data container
    - xcodebuild
        - parallel-testing-worker-count command line option
        - parallel-testing-enabled
- Tips
    - Consider breaking long running classes into multiple classes
    - Put performance tests into a separate bundle with parallelization disabled
    - Understand which tests are not safe for parallelization

## Building for Voice with Siri Shortcuts

### Custom responses

- Template strings in the definition files
- Types of responses: confirmation, success, information, error
- Define a custom intent
- Select a category for your intent
- Declare response properties
- Xcode will code generate custom response subclasses
- Custom UI extension support - shows in Siri, Lock Screen, Search

### Best practices

- Customizing donations
    - Title/Subtitle
        - should represent what happens when you run the shortcut
        - Subtitle could provide more info if needed.
        - Use sentence case
        - Keep title concise
        - Include critical info
        - Include a verb for Intents
        - Localize
        - Dont include name of app
        - Dont duplicate info between title and subtitle
        - Dont use quotations
- `suggestedInvocationPhrase` to aid users with Siri phrase to use to invoke the shortcut
- Localize the strings in your intent definition files
- Can provide shortcut suggestions

### Bringing shortcuts into your app

- Users can create shortcuts inside your app
- Can present the add to Siri UI in your app
- UI for editing shortcuts
- UI to see existing shortcuts

## The Qualities of Great Design

### Interpretation

- What is quality? There are many interpretations.
     - What we agree is good
     - Not random
        - Not slapped together. Considered. Details are visible.
     - A lot of *care* when into it
     - Like someone has though of you
     - Easy to use
     - Focused on what you want to do
     - Easy to get things odone
     - Hard to achieve
- How would you describe care?
    - Care about what the experience of others is rather than just your own design.
    - Care about something naturally gives more time and effort.

### Significance

- Quality impacts the world in our everyday life.
- What is special about quality? The love for what we are doing shines through.
- Why are we drawn to quality? Survival instinct comes into play.
- Quality evokes trust.

### Aspirations

- Simple
    - Instantly understandable - Apps should not be a burnden during real life.
    - It just has to work without causing distraction or losing focus. 
- Stunning
    - High level of polish
    - Active discovery (learn by doing) - rather than passive tooltips
- Timeless
    - Durability of design that stands the test of time
- Positive
    - It has a positive effect on the user's life

### Techniques

- Draw caricatures - Improve understanding - see the world through others eyes
- Prototyping - don't assume that your intial designs will work - go out into the real world and try it
- Be sure to be open to feedback - you can develop blind spots to your own work over time
- Know that you don't know - be modest, be mindful when you design for others
- Ask questions about your design from different perspectives
- Talk about communication with your team

## Whats New in User Notifications

### Grouped Notifications

- Automatic grouping by default
- Use thread identifier for custom grouping
- Note: The user has a system option to group by app or no grouping, which avoids thread ids.
- Summary text option for a notification group

### Content extensions

- Can now have dynamic notification actions for the extension `notificationActions`
- User interactions - Can now receive user interaction events!
- Launching app - can now launch the app from custom user interaction using the default launch action
- Dismissing extension - can now do this from custom UI programatically
    - This does not clear out the notification, it only dismisses it.

### Notification Management

- Users now have more fine grained control over notifications with a management UI.
- Deep link to in-app settings of notifications (can also now be accessed in system settings) - can be useful for a custom settings view

### Provisional Authorization

- Automatic trial of notifications from your app
- No authorization prompt
- Delivered quietly directly to notification center (with no sound)
- `.provisional` when requesting authorization

### Critical Alerts

- Medical/health, home security, public safety
- Require user to take action immediately
- Bypass do not distub and ringer switch
- Plays sound
- Requires an entitlement and approval
- `.criticalAlert` when requesting authorization

## Introducing Natural Language

### Natural Language Framework

### Swifty APIs for NLP

- Language identification - `dominantLanguage`
- Tokenization support
- Named entity recognition

### Custom NLP models

- Types of custom models
    - Text Classification - applay a label to a piece of text
        - Sentiment classification
        - Topic classification
        - Domain classification
    - Word Tagging - take a sentence and apply label to each word
        - Part of speech for unsupported languag
        - Custom named entity recognition
        - Slot parsing (ex: from, to)
        - Chunking words into phrases

### Performance

- Available on all platforms
- Standardized text processing
- Optimized for Apple hardware
- Small model sizes

### Privacy

- Everything is done on device

## Building Faster in Xcode

### Increasing Build Efficiency

- "Paralellelize Build" setting in build scheme - be sure to keep it checked
- See if you can break large test targets with lots of dependencies into separate targets
- Reduce dependency exposure
- Examine unused dependencies
- Parallelized target build process
- Can now have input/output file lists for run script phases (for phases that have lots of input/output files)
- Documentation now available in Xcode 10 for run script phases
- Measuringing build time
- "Build With Timing Summary" new Xcode 10 action
- Dealing with complex expressions
    - Use explicit types for complex computed properties - Speeds up builds and makes code more explicit
    - Provide types in complex closures
    - Break apart complex expressions
    - Use `AnyObject` methods and properties sparingly

### Reducing the Work on Rebuilds

- Turn off Whole Module mode for debug build (use the new incremental setting for debug)
- Incremental builds are file based
- Compiler is conservative when rebuilding
- Changes in function bodies do not affect the files interface
- Dependencies within a module are per-file
- Dependencies across targets are for the whole target
- Mixed source targets
- Keep your generated header minimal
    - Use `private` when possible
    - Use block-based APIs
    - Migrate to Swift 4 (turn off Swift 3 @objc Inference)
- Keep your bridging header minimal
    - Use private categories to break up your interface (less of the interface will be exposed to swift as a result)
