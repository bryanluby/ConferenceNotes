- Messages Framework
    - Built on top of app extensions
    - Not required to have a containing iOS app. Can ship a stand alone iMessage app.
        - The advantage of having a containing app are that the main app will be on the users home screen and the extension will show up in the iMessage app drawer. For the App Store, the main app will show up in the main App Store and the extension will show up in the iMessage App Store.
- Stickers

## Leveraging Touch Input on iOS

- Building a Drawing App
    - See SpeedSketch sample code
    - New API
    - Where to capture strokes in order of priority
        - UIGestureRecognizer
        - UIView
        - The responder chain
    - Use coalesced touches whenever possible
    - Do not draw on every touch event
        - Display refresh rate is 60Hz
        - Incoming event frequency can reach 240Hz and more. Be prepared to receive more events than the display refresh rate.
        - Do not try to draw faster than the screen can refresh. This will add lag and you will be doing work that doesn't get displayed on the screen.
    - When to render?
        - UIView: use `setNeedsDisplay` and move the drawing code into `drawRect`
        - Even better, mark only the changed areas with `setNeedsDisplayInRect`.
        - Activate `drawsAsynchronously` on the view's layer
    - Use predictive touch to improve perceived latency. Add them to your data structure temporarily. Choose their appearance depending on app.
- Apple Pencil
    - Get high precision by using `preciseLocationInView`
    - `touchesMoved` gets called more often with Force.
    - Use tilt and orientation
    - Force is measured along the axis of the pencil. perpendicular force. 
        - Force is measured inside the pencil and transmitted over the air to the iPad
    - Use estimated and estimated properties expecting updates
    - Disable scrolling when using Apple Pencil with allowed touch types on a gesture recognizer
    - Use `requiresExclusiveTouchType` property for uniqueness between touch and Apple Pencil

## Speech Recognition API

- iOS keyboard dictation limitations
    - Requires keyboard
    - Live audio only
    - Can't tell availability
    - Can't customize recording
- Speech api
    - Same tech as Siri
    - Fast and accurate
    - Requires iOS 10
    - Support for 50 languages and dialects
    - Usually requires internet connection - some devices and languages can do it offline
    - Always requires permission from the OS - A good thing to do would be to wait until recognition is used to request it.
    - Provide usage description in Info.plist
- Best Practices
    - Free but not unlimited
    - Per devices, per day limits
    - Per app limits
    - Prepare to handle failures
    - Speech recognition isn't cheap - requires power and data
    - Maximum utterance duration is about one minute for iOS 10
    - Show something in UI that recording is happening
    - Don't use for passwords or other sensitive speech
    - Show recognition results to the user before acting on them. Help them deal with recognition errors.

## Going Server side with Swift Open Source

- Why server-side Swift
    - Same code runs in both places
    - Reduce dev and testing time by sharing code
    - Leverage great APIs on the server 
    - Check out BluePic sample code from IBM
    - IBM Cloud Tools for Swift (Mac App)
- Architecture
    - Linux and Mac platform support
    - Standard Library
    - Foundation, Dispatch, XCTest
    - Compiler Command Line Tools
