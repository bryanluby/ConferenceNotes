## Navigating Indie Life

*By Greg Pierce* [@agiletortoise](https://twitter.com/agiletortoise)

- What is an indy software company? Free from external control and constraint.

        - Disinterested
        - Just not going to get done otherwise (ex documentation)
- Modesty and Vanity
    - Be able to listen to valid feedback

## Legal Survival Kit

*By David Sparks* [@MacSparky](https://twitter.com/MacSparky)

- A lawsuit is a bonfire of $100 dollar bills.
- You are not your clients insurer when anything goes wrong.
- Have written contracts
    - Key terms
        - Describe the work. Be as detailed as possible about scope when you do work for other people.
        - Get paid. Be descriptive on what, when, how you get paid.
        - Avoid liability.
- Danger areas
    - Patent litigation. Put clauses in contracts that say you are not liable for patent lawsuits.
    - Consumer Data. Contract should remove all liability involving consumer data.
    - "One More Thing". Scope expansions should be put in writing with extra costs.
- Legal Error Handling
    - 3 clauses you should have
        - Interest. If they don't pay you you should get interest.
        - Venue. Make location of a dispute your home city.
        - Attorney Fees. Make them pay any attorney fees.
    - Working with contractors
        - Intellectual property. You need to own what they produce.
- The F word: Fairness
    - The goal of the contract is to build a good relationship that benefits everyone, not screw the other person.
- Business Entities
    - Sole proprietorship. Your individual assets are at risk.
    - Corporation. You and your company are separate.
    - Limited Liability Company. Cheap insurance.
    - Piercing the veil.
        - Mixing bank accounts (personal/business)
        - Lack of capitalization
        - Lack of formalities when setting up and running entity

    - Insurance broker. Patent, consumer data insurance coverage.

## Write Your Way Out

*By Matthew Bischoff* [@mb](https://twitter.com/mb)

- What can I get better at? His answer for him always came back to writing.
- Writing is a skill, not a talent.
- Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly.
- Problems crave written solutions.
- Stories
    - Yellow legal pad. Write everything down!
    - Safari view controller blog post led to Apple building it.
- Lessons
    - Again, write *everything* down! If you didn't write it down, it didn't happen.
    - Writing for computers vs humans. Computers are not people. People respond better to stories and empathy.
    - If you can't describe it in words, you can't describe it in code.
    - Don't bullshit. Word choice matters.
    - Writing is rewriting.
    - Writing gets you noticed.
- Questions
    - What do you write?
        - Tasks
        - Ideas
        - App proposals
        - Contracts
        - Blog posts
        - Presentations
        - Documentation (process, code, usage) See ThoughtBot playbook for an example on process.
        - Release notes
        - Welcome letters
        - Reviews (progress, apps, code, useful apps in the App Store)
        - Post mortems
    - How do you get better?
        - Write. Edit. Repeat.
        - Tools are not panaceas.
        - Tools: Day One, 750 words web app
        - Books: On Writing by Stephen King, On Writing Well by William Zinsser, Bird by Bird by Annie LaMott

*By Ariel Michaeli* [@arielmichaeli](https://twitter.com/arielmichaeli)

- The App Store is a busy place. 2.2 million apps. 23 per minute.
- There are more mobile devices than ever before.
- A great app is a *good starting point* for making money.
- The other most important thing is...
- Incorporate making money into your app's design before starting to build it.
- Four easy steps
    - Identify your user
        - What kind of app do they need?
        - Is there anything comparable now?
        - What do they change?
        - What can this user pay?
        - What will this user pay?
        - How much money/time will you be saving them?
        - How much does the user want this app?
        - Who much dose the user need this app?
    - Understand your own economics. What do you need to build and maintain this app?
        - What will the app cost to make?
        - How much to maintain?
        - Can you produce your own content, or license it?
        - Are there ongoing fees?
        - How often would you need to update?
        - Can you do it all alone or do you need to hire help?
        - What do you need to make to keep the lights on?
        - What do you need to grow?
        - Gotchas: legal, accounting, support, insurance, one-off costs
    - Choose a monetization model
        - Consider all of your answers
        - Select a strategy that the user will be happy with and wouldn't consider unrealistic
        - But also would allow to keep the lights on
        - Free with IAP
            - Good: easy for users to get started

        - One size doesn't fit all
        - Once you select a strategy, try out different prices or tiers
        - Set goals and measure everything

## Customer support

*By Sarah Hatter* [@sh](https://twitter.com/sh)

- Author of The Customer Support Handbook
- Terrible customer support is an epidemic in our industry
- Customer support isn't just replying to an email or answering a phone call.
- Empathy
    - There is an overrepresentation of introverts in software development.
    - In customer support there is mostly extroverts.
    - You may not be the best person for customer support and thats ok.
    - Fake it till you make it
    - Transactional vs relational
    - Customer support is a habitual experience your user has with your app.
    - Customers have baggage. No one ever wants to even call customer service.
    - The best method of customer support is building things that don't require support.
    - Empathy is thinking forward for solutions base on your experience and what you'd want to happen.
    - Empathy works both ways: you'll feel better and they will to
- Paying Attention
    - Language is the fastest and easiest change you can make.
    - You also need to do something with what you observe
    - Customers need to feel like you are thinking about their needs
    - Empty Words
        - Hello
        - Thank you for your feedback
    - Full words
        - Hi, thanks, I'm sorry, you're right

- Alive with Possibility
- Mainly an inspirational talk about his experiences in App Development and building GauRider

## Better Marketing Through Cupcakes

*By Rich Siegel* [@siegel](https://twitter.com/siegel)

- Early part of talk is about history of software distribution
- The end of physical distribution of software led to an indie explosion
- Although, easiness of shipping has led to more supply and competition and lower prices
- Disruption of sustainable revenue models (ex. no upgrades in App Store)
- Every product costs you money to release (ex. BBEdit and TextWrangler overlap).
    - Branding/marketing
    - Documentation
    - Build system
    - QA/release/support
- Apple is no longer a neutral force in the developer ecosystem
    - App pricing has its roots in the .99 iTunes song pricing model.
    - Similar to CompUSA, Apple has all control over what is featured
- What can *we* do?
    - Make pricing reflect value
    - Market the product according to its value, not its price
    - Don't rely on luck. 
    - Add value through Customer Contact
        - Each is a marketing opportunity.
        - Successful outcome is a future business opportunity
        - Email
            - Sound like a human. Friendly and open, but professional.
            - "Yes Sandwich".
                - Two slices of yes with a no in the middle.
                - "Thanks for writing in."
                - "We regret..."
                - "Yes We will... and thanks again"
            - Reading comprehension is important.
            - Be responsive
            - Feature requests
                - If already present, tell them where to find it.
                - If already planned, offer them a beta build.
                - No way, give "Yes Sandwich"
            - Bug reports
                - Humility is important.
                - Known issues, offer a beta
                - Can't reproduce, offer another yes sandwich
        - Marketing on Twitter
            - Engagement, not blasting
            - Awareness goes two ways
            - Strengthen and redirect contacts to customer support

## Independent Experience

*By Stephen Hackett* [@ismh](https://twitter.com/ismh)

- *Inspirational storytelling*
- "If not now, when?"
- Life is great with a good co-founder
- Independent life was not what he was expecting. Some misconceptions:
    - You'll see your family more
    - You'll work less
    - You'll be less stressed
    - You'll have more freedom
    - You'll be happier. Our mental health is more important that getting a product shipped.
- It is time to make some adjustments
    - Looking at quarterly goals
    - Rely on advisers
    - Don't blend work and non-work in you home *space*
    - Bring on assistant
    - Get better at saying no
- To infinity and beyond
    - Remember how fortunate we all are that we can do this work
    - Everyone has their own unique story - Think about yours
